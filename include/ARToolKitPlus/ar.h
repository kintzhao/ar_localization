    Detailed Description

    main structure for detected marker.

    Store information after contour detection (in idea screen coordinate, after distorsion compensated).

    Remarks:
        lines are represented by 3 values a,b,c for ax+by+c=0

    Parameters:
        area	number of pixels in the labeled region
        id	marker identitied number
        dir	Direction that tells about the rotation about the marker (possible values are 0, 1, 2 or 3). This parameter makes it possible to tell about the line order of the detected marker (so which line is the first one) and so find the first vertex. This is important to compute the transformation matrix in arGetTransMat().
        cf	confidence value (probability to be a marker)
        pos	center of marker (in ideal screen coordinates)
        line	line equations for four side of the marker (in ideal screen coordinates)
        vertex	edge points of the marker (in ideal screen coordinates) */

        internal structure use for marker detection.

        Store information after contour detection (in observed screen coordinate, before distorsion correction).

        Parameters:
            area	number of pixels in the labeled region
            pos	position of the center of the marker (in observed screen coordinates)
            coord_num	numer of pixels in the contour.
            x_coord	x coordinate of the pixels of contours (size limited by AR_CHAIN_MAX).
            y_coord	y coordinate of the pixels of contours (size limited by AR_CHAIN_MAX).
            vertex	position of the vertices of the marker. (in observed screen coordinates) rem:the first vertex is stored again as the 5th entry in the array ï¿½ for convenience of drawing a line-strip easier.
